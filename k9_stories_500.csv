The Invisible Enemy,Leela,"I was designed by Professor Marius for his own use, but upon his return to Earth, he kindly gifted me to the Doctor and his companion, Mistress Leela"
The Invisible Enemy,Leela,"I was put to the test when the Doctor received a distress call from Titan Base. We soon discovered the source of the distress call was a strange virus that had infected the base and the human crew. The Doctor and Mistress Romana were also infected, but the Doctor was chosen by the Nucleus of the Swarm as its host due to his incredible powers as a Time Lord. Mistress Leela was deemed a reject and ordered to be killed. "
The Invisible Enemy,Leela,"At the medical centre, I was introduced to the Doctor and Mistress Leela. Professor Marius tried to find a way to cure the Doctor's infection. The Doctor and Mistress Romana created clones of themselves, which were shrunk and inserted into the Doctor's body to destroy the Nucleus. While they were on this mission, I fought off the infected staff of the hospital"
The Invisible Enemy,Leela,"We left for Titan Base to fight off the infected humans and destroy the Nucleus and its many children. The Doctor rigged a gun to fire into a cloud of oxygen gas and we escaped. The gun ignited the oxygen in Titan's methane atmosphere and destroyed the Swarm and the base. The Doctor and Mistress Leela took me with them in the TARDIS, and I have been their loyal companion ever since."
The Sunmakers,Leela,"Doctor Master and mistress Leela were on a mission to help the inhabitants of Pluto. It wasn't long before we were met with resistance from the greedy Gatherer of Megropolis One, Hade. He sent his private guard, the Inner Retinue, to take us down. Doctor Master and mistress Leela were captured and I was forced to search for help."
The Sunmakers,Leela,"I eventually returned to the Undercity with a plan to rescue Doctor Master and mistress Leela from the Correction Centre. Luckily, Doctor Master had already escaped, but I was still determined to save mistress Leela. I, along with Cordo and Bisham, attacked the guards and released her. However, she was injured and fell from the troop transporter. "
The Sunmakers,Leela,"Doctor Master and I then ventured to the Collector's Palace, where I noticed the Collector was a Usurian. Before the Collector could do any more harm the Doctor Master managed to sabotage the computer system, and the shock of the projected bankruptcy caused the Collector to liquidise himself."
The Underworld,Leela,"The Minyans looked upon the Time Lords as gods, which made Doctor Master and Mistress both proud and embarrassed. After being expelled by the Minyans, Doctor Master and Mistress followed a policy of non-intervention. However, the Minyans were still resentful of the gifts of science given to them by the Time Lords, which had ultimately caused their civil war and destruction of their world. "
The Underworld,Leela,"We arrived at the edge of the expanding universe, on the R1C, a Minyan ship. A crew of four – Jackson, Herrick, Orfe and Tala – had been on a quest for millennia, searching for a missing ship, the P7E. This ship had been carrying the genetic race banks of the entire species and had disappeared en route to Minyos II."
The Underworld,Leela,"On the P7E planetoid, civilisation had taken a curious turn – most of the population were slaves, digging rock for fuel and sustenance, and were culled and killed in rock collapses called Skyfalls. The two robots Seers and the powerful super-computer Oracle were in overall control of this perverse society. "
The Underworld,Leela,"Doctor Master and Mistress encountered Idas, a young man nearly killed in a Skyfall, and learnt about the situation on the planetoid. They rescued Idas’ father Idmon, who was due to be sacrificed to the Oracle, as well as other slaves. Doctor Master and Mistress ventured to the Citadel at the heart of the planetoid, where the Seers had captured Herrick and given him what he thought were the two race banks to take back to the R1C."
The Underworld,Leela,"Doctor Master and Mistress succeeded in locating and stealing the real race banks and escaped with them. The Doctor gave the real race banks to Jackson and engineered the fission grenades that were returned to the Oracle. Idas rounded up the other slaves and led them to the safety of the R1C, while the Doctor, Mistress and I made our way back to the probe ship."
The Underworld,Leela,"As the R1C blasted away, loaded with the slaves and the race banks, Doctor Master had taken the fakes out of the craft, and it was pushed outward from the planetoid by the explosion of the fission grenades. We wished the Minyans well as they continued their journey to Minyos II."
The Invasion of Time,Leela,"I accompanied my Mistress and the Doctor Master to the Citadel at Gallifrey. I was confused as to why the Doctor Master would have a covert meeting with aliens, but it was soon revealed that he was the only candidate to take up the vacant Presidency. During the induction ceremony, the Crown of Rassilon seemed to reject the Doctor Master and he was injured, resulting in Mistress Leela being accused of attacking him."
The Invasion of Time,Leela,"In reality, Mistress Leela was merely trying to help him. The Doctor Master then brought in three figures, the Vardans, which Mistress Leela and I found confusing. The Doctor Master informed Mistress Leela and I that the Vardans can read thoughts, but lead blocks this power. He then told the Citadel guard commander Andred that he planned to lock the Vardans away in a time lock on their home planet and that Mistress Leela had to be banished for her own safety. "
The Invasion of Time,Leela,"Afterwards, Mistress Leela and Time Lady Rodan traveled across the wastelands of Gallifrey, gathering a resistance force to help take back the Citadel. The Doctor Master then tricked the Vardans, and I was able to trace their home planet and engage the time lock. "
The Invasion of Time,Leela,"We were then suprised to find that the Sontarans had used the confusion to invade Gallifrey. The Doctor Master then needed the Great Key of Rassilon, which he used to power a Demat Gun, a weapon that erases its target from all of time. He fired the Demat Gun and the Sontaran invaders disappeared, ending the threat"
The Invasion of Time,Leela,"With the situation resolved, Mistress Leela and I decided to stay behind with Andred and help rebuild the Citadel. The Doctor Master built another one of me so we could continue our travels."
The Ribos Operation,Romana,"I stood watchfully beside my Doctor Master and Mistress as the White Guardian ordered them to assemble the Key to Time. He warned of the Black Guardian's evil purpose and gave them a locator to find the concealed pieces of the Key to Time. We traveled to Cyrrenhis Minima, and then to Ribos. We soon found ourselves in the midst of a scam orchestrated by a human from Earth named Garron"
The Ribos Operation,Romana,"Garron had planted a piece of jethrik among the Ribos crown jewels, and the locator identified it as the disguised segment of the Key to Time. This prompted an exiled tyrant called the Graff Vynda-K to offer a large sum of money for the planet. Garron's assistant Unstoffe recovered the money and the jethrik from the safe, and hid with a native named Binro."
The Ribos Operation,Romana,"The Ribos guards summoned a Seeker who tracked Unstoffe's whereabouts, but I helped the Doctor, Romana, and Garron escape to the Catacombs. The Graff and his men entered the Catacombs, but the Doctor swapped the jethrik for the Graff's explosive, causing him to walk off into the maze and explode. The Doctor Master, mistress Romana, and I departed in the TARDIS and transformed the jethrik into the first piece of the Key to Time."
The Pirate Planet,Romana,"I arrived on the cold and boring planet of Calufrax with my master and mistress. I noticed the strange band of people with mysterious powers known as the Mentiads who were feared by the society. My master discovered that they were actually good people but with an unknown purpose. He instead feared the Captain, the planet's leader and benefactor. "
The Pirate Planet,Romana,"After meeting the Captain on the bridge, we learned that we were actually on a hollowed-out planet named Zanak. The Captain had a plan to take Zanak to Earth but my master soon discovered the true menace controlling the Captain was an ancient tyrant Queen Xanxia. "
The Pirate Planet,Romana,"I noticed that the Key to Time locator was giving odd signals that seemed to indicate that the segment was everywhere. Once my master and mistress saw the Captain's trophy room of planets, they concluded that Calufrax was the segment that they were looking for. The Captain's plan was to use the gravitational power of all the crushed worlds to essentially drill a hole through the time dams, bypass its fail-safe mechanism, and let time move forward so the queen dies. "
The Pirate Planet,Romana,"My master used the TARDIS to disrupt Zanak's materialisation around Earth while the Mentiads sabotaged the engines. I killed the Polyphase Avatron, the Captain's deadly robot parrot. The Captain's plan failed and my master sent Calufrax off into the time/space continuum where we later picked it up. I was proud to have been part of this mission and I was glad that we were able to save many planets from being destroyed by Queen Xanxia."
The Stones of Blood,Romana,"As we arrived in modern-day Cornwall, Doctor Master and mistress began their search for the third segment of the Key to Time. Doctor Master and mistress soon encountered Professor Emilia Rumford and her friend Vivien Fay, studying the ""Nine Travellers"" standing stones in Boscombe Moor. "
The Stones of Blood,Romana,"We were soon met with hostility by a Druidic sect that worships the Cailleach, the Druidic goddess of war and magic, led by de Vries. Doctor Master was able to determine that the stones were alien beings called the Ogri that fed on blood. They were very difficult to stop and one almost destroyed me. "
The Stones of Blood,Romana,"The Mistress caught Vivien awakening more stones with blood and she used a device to send her to a spacecraft in hyperspace. Doctor Master then constructed a projector to cross into hyperspace, leaving me and Emilia to guard it. "
The Stones of Blood,Romana,"On the spacecraft, Doctor Master determined it was a prison ship and inadvertently released two floating globes called Megara that served as justice machines. It was then revealed that Vivien was Cessair, a criminal who had stolen the Great Seal of the planet Diplos. The Megara then fired an energy weapon at Doctor Master, but at the last moment, the Doctor dragged Vivien into the shot. The Megara immediately ceased their attack and scanned Vivien, discovering that she was Cessair. "
The Stones of Blood,Romana,"Doctor Master recovered the Great Seal and the Megara were forced to return to their ship and depart to Diplos. I was so glad that Doctor Master, mistress, and I were able to safely leave with the third segment of the Key to Time. I was also pleased that Emilia was safe and unharmed throughout the mission and now had a new stone in the circle to study."
The Androids of Tara,Romana,I stayed in the TARDIS while Doctor Master and mistress Romana set out to investigate the planet of Tara. Doctor Master and Mistress Romana were in search of the fourth segment of the Key to Time. Doctor Master went fishing while Mistress Romana worked on transforming the fourth segment of the Key to Time.
The Androids of Tara,Romana,"Suddenly, Mistress Romana was attacked by a Taran bear and was only saved by Count Grendel. He brought Mistress Romana back to his castle, believing she was an android. He ordered her to be disassembled, but just in time, Madame Lamia realized Mistress Romana was real. "
The Androids of Tara,Romana,"Doctor Master had recruited Zadek and Farrah to help Prince Reynart and they came up with a plan to use an android copy as a decoy to help Reynart reach his coronation. However, Grendel struck first and kidnapped Reynart himself. Doctor Master called me in to help him with the plan. "
The Androids of Tara,Romana,"Together, Doctor Master, Zadek and Farrah snuck the android Reynart into the throne room. Just in time, Strella appeared, but Doctor Master recognized she was an android and hit her with the King's sceptre. "
The Androids of Tara,Romana,"Till from Grendel's team then offered Doctor Master a chance to collect Mistress Romana from the Pavilion of the Summer Winds, but it was a trap by Grendel. I detected the android Romana and took it out. Mistress Romana then arrived in time to help Doctor Master flee. "
The Androids of Tara,Romana,"Grendel then plotted to have Romana pose as Strella and marry Reynart at Castle Gracht. Doctor Master called on me to help him gain access to the castle. Just in time, Doctor Master reached the throne room and stopped the marriage. He then engaged the Count in a duel and defeated him."
The Androids of Tara,Romana,"Ultimately, Mistress Romana was freed and Strella was reunited with Reynart. Doctor Master, Mistress Romana and I departed, having retrieved the fourth segment of the Key to Time."
The Armageddon Factor,Romana,"We arrived on the planet Atrios, which had endured a recent bombing by the neighbouring planet Zeos. We find that Zeos is deserted save for the giant computer Mentalis, which is controlling the war. We also discover that the true opponent is a third planet called the Planet of Evil, ruled by ""the Shadow""."
The Armageddon Factor,Romana,"The Shadow has Princess Astra of Atrios captive, threatening to torture her if she doesn't give him the location of the final segment of the Key to Time. On the Planet of Evil, the Doctor Master encounters another Time Lord, Drax, who he last met at the Academy. Drax has been employed under duress by the Shadow but agrees to help the Doctor Master. "
The Armageddon Factor,Romana,"The Doctor Master leads a servant of the Shadow, known as a Mute, to his TARDIS and opens the door, but is suddenly shrunk to tiny size by Drax. Drax had misinterpreted the Doctor Master's plan and shrank the Doctor Master instead of the Mute. The Mute returns to the Shadow with the Key, and the Doctor Master realises why the Shadow has requested it: Astra is the final segment, and is transformed in front of everyone. "
The Armageddon Factor,Romana,"Using their diminished size, the Doctor Master and Drax smuggle themselves inside me into the Shadow's lair. I was a Trojan dog! Drax again uses the stabiliser, this time to return them to their normal size. The Doctor Master snatches the partially assembled Key and the final segment and disappears with mistress Romana and me in the TARDIS, assembling the Key to save the day!"
The Creature from the Pit,Romana,"Along with my Doctor Master and mistress Romana, we discovered a distress signal and were drawn to the lush jungle world of Chloris. In this metal-poor world, the icy and callous Lady Adrasta held power through fear and her control of the planet's last metal mine. After discovering the remains of an enormous egg in the jungle, Doctor Master and mistress Romana ventured out to meet the inhabitants."
The Creature from the Pit,Romana,"Mistress Romana was captured by a party of scavengers, and it was up to me to enable her escape. I was a particular hit with these metal-hungry idiots. After being reunited briefly with Doctor Master, he leapt into a deep Pit determined to get to the bottom of the mystery. "
The Creature from the Pit,Romana,"In the pit he encountered Organon, and then the Creature, a vast shapeless blob that drew a picture of the shield from Adrasta’s throne room. The scavengers had raided Adrasta’s throne room and taken the alien shield. With my help, Doctor Master was able to arrive at the bottom of the Pit before Adrasta, her lady-in-waiting, the Huntsman, and his Wolfweeds."
The Creature from the Pit,Romana,"It turns out the shield was a communication device and the Creature was the Tythonian ambassador to Chloris. Lady Adrasta had imprisoned Erato to maintain her power, but the Doctor was able to arrange Erato's escape. Unfortunately, Tythonus had declared war on Chloris over the missing ambassador and had despatched a neutron star to collide with Chloris’ star and destroy the system. With my assistance, Doctor Master was able to draw the star off-course and neutralise the danger."
The Creature from the Pit,Romana,"The Doctor Master then encouraged the Huntsman, now one of the de facto rulers, toward a mutually beneficial trade agreement with Erato and the Tythonians. It was a great victory, and Doctor Master, mistress Romana, and I were glad to have helped."
Nightmare on Eden,Romana,"I arrived with the Doctor and Mistress to a strange area on an interstellar cruise ship, the Empress. The Doctor offered his services to separate the Empress from another ship, the Hecate, which had emerged from hyperspace at the same co-ordinates. I was tasked with cutting through the locked ships in order to separate them. "
Nightmare on Eden,Romana,"When we found the co-pilot, Secker, he had been attacked by a clawed monster called a Mandrel and left for dead. I used my blaster fire to repel the Mandrel while the Doctor and Rigg refitted the segment of the craft. I then spotted a silver-suited stranger who the Doctor pursued into the blurred area between ships."
Nightmare on Eden,Romana,"The Doctor and Mistress discovered that Rigg had become addicted to the drug Vraxoin, and that Tryst and Della, who were aboard the Empress, were trying to smuggle it. The Mandrels, that were originally from Eden, were actually the source of the drug Vraxoin."
Nightmare on Eden,Romana,"I helped protect the Doctor and Mistress when they were trying to reverse the CET transfer process to stop the smugglers. In the end, we successfully separated the Empress and Hecate, the drug runners were caught, and we returned to the TARDIS with the Eden projection restored. We can only hope no one else discovers the secret of the Mandrels."
Horns of Nimon,Romana,"The Doctor Master and mistress Romana boarded a transport ship bearing sacrifices from Aneth. I remained outside the ship, but was able to help the Doctor Master by steering the TARDIS away from the black hole and to Skonnos. Once there, I was held captive in Soldeed's laboratory and was unable to help the Doctor and mistress Romana when they were forced to carry the hymetusite crystals into the Power Complex. "
Horns of Nimon,Romana,"Within the labyrinth, the Doctor and mistress Romana encountered the Nimon, who had the power to fire deadly laser beams from their horns. They defeated them by blowing up the power complex. I then guided the Doctor Master and the Mistress out of the labyrinth using my sensors."
Shada,Romana,"I accompanied Doctor Master and mistress Romana on their mission to help the old professor Chronotis. We encountered the mad scientist Skagra and his sphere, who tried to extract the Doctor Master's mind. The Doctor Master managed to survive this ordeal and we were able to find Skagra's old space station. "
Shada,Romana,"We discovered that Skagra was after a Time Lord named Salyavin. Back on Earth, Clare Keightley accidentally revived Chronotis. It was then revealed that Chronotis owned a TARDIS and the book was a key to the prison planet Shada. "
Shada,Romana,"We reached Skagra's carrier and saved the Doctor Master and Chris. But, Skagra had already decoded the book and was set on absorbing Salyavin's mind. We got to Shada and Skagra released the prisoners, with Chronotis revealed as Salyavin. "
Shada,Romana,The Doctor Master was able to build a telepathy helmet to wrestle control back from Skagra. The Krarg were destroyed and Skagra ended up imprisoned back in his ship. The Doctor Master then returned the prisoners to Shada and parted ways with Chronotis. 
The Leisure Hive,Romana,"The Doctor Master and Mistress decided to take a holiday to Brighton. The sea air is nice and the sights are interesting. My excitement was quickly washed away when I began to chase a ball and lost my traction. Before I knew it, I was submerged in cold seawater and I began to spark and explode. The Doctor Master and Mistress were horrified and tried their best to contain the damage. To cheer themselves up they continued their holiday on Argolis at the Leisure Hive."
Meglos,Romana,"We had been travelling to the Prion star system, which contained two habitable planets, Zolfa-Thura and Tigella. Doctor Master was summoned by Zastor, the leader of Tigella, to investigate the strange fluctuations in the energy source of their civilisation. When we tried to land on Tigella, we were pulled into a time bubble, trapping us in a pocket of time and repeating it over and over again. It was soon apparent that the culprit was Meglos, a cactus creature from Zolfa-Thura. "
Meglos,Romana,"Meglos had summoned a band of space pirates called the Gaztaks to help him steal the Dodecahedron, a twelve-sided crystal which was the source of Tigella’s energy. He used an Earthling to occupy the Doctor’s form and infiltrate the city. Doctor Master and Mistress Romana eventually managed to break out of the bubble by tweaking my tail, and I accompanied them as they headed for the city. "
Meglos,Romana,"We were able to stop Meglos from using the Dodecahedron to power a weapon, and ultimately witnessed the destruction of Zolfa-Thura. The Doctor Master and Mistress Romana prepared to take the Earthling home, but before they left Mistress Romana received a message from the Time Lords that she must return to Gallifrey."
Full Circle,Romana,"As we attempted to travel to Gallifrey, the TARDIS travelled through a Charged Vacuum Emboitement and landed on the tropical planet of Alzarius in E-Space. Once there I followed the Doctor Master to a swamp, where we encountered the aggressive Marshmen. While the Doctor and Mistress Romana attempted to maneuver the situation, I followed the Marshmen and kept watch. As I continued to trail the Marshmen, I eventually reached a river bed that I was unable to cross so I returned to the TARDIS."
Full Circle,Romana,"I located the TARDIS in a cave, where the Marshmen were trying to gain entry. Mistress Romana decided to venture outside and I attempted to rescue her. Unfortunately, during the rescue I had my head removed from my body and I cannot remember anything else."
State of Decay,Romana,"As Doctor Master and mistress set off to explore the isolated planet, I am left behind to guard the TARDIS. But before they can leave, Adric attempts to sneak out of the TARDIS. I confront him, but he insists that it would be best for him to leave with the Doctor and mistress. "
State of Decay,Romana,The Doctor Master summoned me to a camp using his whistle. The camp was full of scared villagers who want to overthrow the three who rule. I was given the task of leading a raid to save mistress from being sacrificed to them. My laser quickly disabled the guards and I was able to save mistress.
State of Decay,Romana,I then detected the sound of the scout ship that Doctor Master has launched from the tower top and instructed my force to evacuate. The noise distracted the Three Who Rule and Adric helped the mistress to safety. The steel frontage of the scout ship impaled the vampire under the tower and the three who rule crumbled to dust.
Warrior's Gate,Romana,Warrior’s Gate is where I left the TARDIS and travelled with mistress Romana. Our adventure began when the TARDIS became trapped in a white null space between two universes while travelling between E-Space and N-Space.
Warrior's Gate,Romana,"Unfortunately, the winds of time shredded my memory wafers, leaving me functional but without long-term memories. The Doctor Master decided to explore our new environment and encountered robots, called Gundans. Meanwhile, Mistress Romana left to speak to the crew on the slave vessel, but she was tricked into returning to their ship."
Warrior's Gate,Romana,"Adric and I left to save Mistress Romana, but we were separated. Adric managed to hide aboard the ship, while I found the Doctor Master and assisted him with repairing one of the Gundan. We found out they had been built by slaves and used to overthrow their masters. Before we could complete the repairs, however, Rorvik and his men arrived. We were saved by another Gundan that walked through the seemingly solid mirror. "
Warrior's Gate,Romana,"Mistress Romana was soon freed by another Tharil, Lazlo, and we were reunited on the other side of the mirror. It was here that we learned that the Tharils had been masters, not slaves, and had been travelling on the winds of time in order to ravage other planets. We managed to free the remaining Tharils, and Romana decided to stay with them, so the Doctor Master gave her me as I could not return to N-Space."
School Reunion,Sarah Jane,My sensors had detected a strange phenomenon. The chip oil in the school lunches has caused a strange increase in the performance of the students at Deffry Value School. Mistress Sarah Jane and I investigate the school and I identify the oil as Krillitane oil. I remained in the boot of mistress Sarah Jane's car while they investigated further. 
School Reunion,Sarah Jane,"Doctor Master and mistress Sarah Jane confront the headmaster, Mr Finch, who confirms that he and other staff members are Krillitanes, and they are using the students to solve the Skasis Paradigm. Mickey and I used the car to break into the school and free the children."
School Reunion,Sarah Jane,"Doctor Master and mistress Sarah Jane lead the Krillitanes to the kitchen, where I detonated the chip oil container. I was destroyed along with the Krillitanes. Mistress Sarah Jane decided not to travel with the Doctor Master again, and as a parting gift, Doctor Master gave her another version of me."
